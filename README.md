# Fermware
### Python web app for recommending beers 

## GOAL
The goal of this project is to develop an application that recommends beers based on a users preference. With hundreds of beers to choose from in an average store, finding the next one to try can be a difficult task that often results in defaulting to a safe choice. Nobody wants to venture out, spending $15 on a six pack just to hate the taste and realize no brew is the same. With vague descriptions from "Hazy IPA" to "Light Lager", without tasting it finding the right beer can take gallons of tasting to find. By including descriptions and flavor profiles of each beer, users will be able to learn which styles they most enjoy and develop a Ferm-ware of their own!

## TODO
- Scrape a list of beers with their style, type, and flavor profile as well as additional supporting information
- Create a model to take a users preferences and return suggestions based on them
- Add additional information page about each beer and their description
